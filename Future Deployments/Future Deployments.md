# Future Deployments on OCI Free Tier

This folder outlines my plans to deploy **Java applications** and other projects on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Free Tier**, applying the skills learned from the OCI Foundations Associate certification and hands-on labs.


## ðŸš€ Deployment Goals

1. **Host Java Web Applications**
   - Use **OCI Compute instances** to deploy small web apps (Spring Boot or simple Java servlets)
   - Configure VM instances, security lists, and public IPs

2. **Use Object Storage**
   - Store static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files
   - Practice permissions and access control

3. **Configure Networking**
   - Set up VCN, subnets, and routing for deployed apps
   - Implement basic security measures to allow public access

4. **Apply Cloud Concepts**
   - Practice scaling strategies, monitoring, and cost management
   - Use OCI console to manage resources efficiently


## ðŸ“Œ Learning Outcomes

- Gain **real-world cloud deployment experience**
- Understand **integration of compute, storage, and networking**
- Document the **entire deployment process** in GitHub
- Build a foundation for future **cloud-based projects**
